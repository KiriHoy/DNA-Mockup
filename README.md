DNA Website Mockup
==========================

> This is a prototype of the DNA website

## How it works

In your directory you have a `package.json` file. This file points to dependencies to install when running `npm install`. When you run `npm install` you install all of the Design System components and additional packages related to the local development environment.

After `npm install` [Pancake](https://github.com/govau/pancake) is ran, this checks that your dependencies work together and creates the `docs/js/script.min.js` and `src/sass/_uikit.scss`.

The `src/sass/main.scss` imports the generated `_uikit.scss`. You shouldn't touch the `_uikit.scss` file as it is generated, but feel free to change the `main.scss` file. 

When the user runs `npm run build` or `npm run watch` we use [node-sass]("https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass?activeTab=versions") to convert the `src/sass/main.scss` file into the `docs/css/main.css` file. [Autoprefixer]("https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer") is ran after compilation to add vendor prefixes to the `main.css` file.

> Refer to the `package.json` scripts for how this has been set up

This set up allows you to modify the variables in the Design System file from the `main.scss` file. You can add your own colour scheme, or change the typography and spacing. Tweaks to the components or additional ones should be added below the import of `_uikit.scss`. Changes to these files will be injected into your browser so you don’t even need to refresh thanks to [Browser Sync](https://www.browsersync.io/).

The `docs` folder in the contains all the files required to publish a website. The `index.html` file references the `main.css` file and `script.min.js` assets to generate the page. We name the folder `docs` because [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses the docs folder to host static websites.
